## üîÅ Steps Performed

1. **Upload Image**
   - Upload any product photo (preferably from [https://www.sabhyasha.com](https://www.sabhyasha.com)).

2. **Background Removal**
   - Background is removed using the `rembg` API.

3. **Square Cropping**
   - Image is center-cropped and resized to a perfect 1:1 square using `Pillow`.

4. **Mask Generation**
   - A mask is auto-generated from the transparent background to preserve the product and only modify the background.

5. **Stable Diffusion Inpainting**
   - Using `runwayml/stable-diffusion-inpainting`, the pipeline fills in a new background based on descriptive prompts.

6. **Prompt Variants**
   - The same product is placed in 3 white studio-style prompt environments with slight variations in lighting, shadow, and wording for diversity.

7. **Download Final Results**
   - Images are saved and can be downloaded in the final cell.
